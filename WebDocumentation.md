# DH 199 - Like a Local.

Rachel Liu | DH-199 | Fall 2023

## Project Description
Within this DH 199 course, I wanted to utilize digital technology to alleviate the interpersonal language barrier while also preserving the humanity of intercultural communication. This project is therefore two-fold. Not only must this app alleviate the language barrier to assist with interpersonal communication, such as verbal language translation, but must also aid users in intercultural communication, such as body language and etiquette. The idea for this digital communication tool came about during my family’s summer vacation trip to a foreign country. Although overall a great experience, it was slowly realized that our main goal, to fully learn and experience the culture, was missing because we were simply unable to communicate with the local people around us. Yes, one of those reasons for the lack of communication was a language barrier, but it was more than that – we felt like we couldn’t connect with them. Of course, quite a few applications were downloaded in an attempt to overcome this barrier, but none came close to helping us navigate the intricacies of culture-specific communication.

This project will be completed using a user-centered design process which incorporates an interactive 5 step process. First, I would conduct a literature review of existing apps, conduct field research using relevant methodologies, create personas and user flows, low fidelity prototyping, and usability tests. The typical process would include high fidelity prototypes, but due to time constraints and a personal decision to have a stronger focus on research analysis, this step has been removed. 

### Expected Outcome
The outcome of my project will be a web documentation of the design process, a low-fidelity prototype of the application, and a final research paper.

## Literature Review
It is a given that modern-day travel will incorporate digital tools one way or another, whether that be during the planning stages of a trip or during the trip experience itself. To accompany a world that aims to remove siloes and grow ever-more intertwined and complex, it is urgent that a tool be built to assist in the creation of these communities, no matter how fleeting. When it comes to the user experience of digital tools, previous research has shown 55 percent of travel apps were purchased within 3 days of travel or even while travelers were at the destination, demonstrating the importance of on-demand mobile apps  (Mickaiel). When delving into the specifics of these downloaded apps, a 2012 study showed “Single City Destination Guide” and "Language Assistant” apps were the most downloaded (Wang and Xiang). In other words, users depend highly on tools to assist in optimizing experience and communication. 

However, with the technological boom comes an inevitable lust for financial gain. Digital tools built to constantly maximize monetary benefit at the expense of users have terrifying impacts for humanity, especially in terms of cognitive, social, emotional, and ethical implications (Ananou and Tamamoto). 
Keeping those implications in mind, between two users of different backgrounds, languages, and cultures, translation apps tend to serve as the only middleman in the interaction. Therefore, it is important to optimize this experience by building a tool that not only facilitates practical language communication, but emphasizes cultural context to preserve humanity. Here, <b>“practical language communication” is defined as the facilitation of basic communication while “cultural context” is defined as preserving humanity through cultural awareness.</b>

## Design Statement
Based on previous literature regarding mobile applications for tourism, preservation of humanity in the digital age, barriers to intercultural communication, and a brief analysis on existing language and culture technologies, the proposed solution will be a digital tool tailored to the visitors of a foreign country and will accomplish two main goals. Not only will this project provide evidence-based recommendations and a functional prototype of an on-demand digital tool which alleviates the interpersonal communication barriers, but will put a focus on preserving humanity by facilitating intercultural human connection through etiquette literacy. This hypothetical tool will successfully resolve the research goal of “How might we utilize digital technology to alleviate the interpersonal language barrier and preserve the humanity of intercultural communication?”

## Generative Research 
To answer the research question of how we might utilize digital technology to alleviate the interpersonal language barrier and preserve the humanity of intercultural communication, it was first necessary to define a target audience. Through research and conversation, it was determined that the target audience focus for the first release would be American tourists who want to understand, experience, and (as much as possible) integrate into certain aspects of the local way of life with minimum prior research or preparation. In the context of this paper, “local way of life” refers to an experience that involves culturally mindful living – where a non-native speaker is still able to learn about experiences which set the region’s culture apart from their own, in the context of the region itself. 
The two research methods that were employed were 1) visual ethnography and 2) user interviews, which will be further explained in the following sections with accompanying screenshots. Please refer to the Resource List at the end of this report to view these screenshots as the original high-quality file type.

### Visual Anthropology Outcomes
After taking photos of the areas and people around Koreatown, I continued developing my findings into a list of outcomes.
1. Tourists from the local LA area travel into Koreatown for the purpose of experiencing ethnic Asian cuisine.
2. Areas which are not Catered To Tourists (nCTT) are visibly distinguishable from areas which are Catered To Tourists (CTT) because surrounding signs and shop names are in Korean, with only a few including the English translation of shop names.
3. nCTT areas were closed or closed early on Sundays due to church. 
* The only section that was open was cosmetics. Visibly, this was one of the larger booths which contained lots of serums, wipes, and natural skincare products. No heavy or colorful makeup. In fact, all the Korean models had clear, natural, pale faces.
* Names of the product/brand were almost all in English but the rest was in Korean. Regardless, the purpose of each product was easy to hypothesize due to the large image on the front of the package.
4. CTT's food court area inside of Koreatown’s Olympic Galleria was the busiest compared to the surrounding area. The space was clean and trash-free, decorations were bright and attention-grabbing with modern technology such as neon signs. Demographics consisted of tourists, local Koreans, and Latinos, many of which came with their families. There was minimal interaction between groups.
* CTT menu items followed a similar format: Number in the top left corner, large image of food, Korean item name, English item name, and price in USD.
* Prices for food were shockinly expensive – I’m assuming because of high rent which is due to increased foot traffic in CTT areas.
* All booths were manned by Asian immigrants, many of which did not speak English. When I asked for a sauce holder, the lady made a questioning tone. I tried to ask again but she waved me off to her coworker.  The next person understood a little better, and repeated my phrase while grabbing the requested item.
5. HMart serves the Asian population in LA, hence the English, Korean, and Chinese characters written on the sign. Asian friends will either go to HMart to buy ethnic foods, or order off of Wee! (delivery app).
* Workers don’t speak much English. I witnessed one person trying to find a specific product. Only until the customer said the product name in Korean did the worker lead her to the correct area of the store.
6. Some areas had large unfinished construction projects. Graffiti on the nearby building showed it had been a while since anyone last entered the area. The glass is smashed at the bus stop nearby. Does not seem well-maintained outside CTT areas.

### User Interviews Outcomes
The user interview research findings were a result of analysis from participants to recall and relay anecdotal evidence regarding recent travel experiences in varying foreign countries. They are listed as follows:
 
#### Travel Purpose and Motivation
1. The area was well known or spoken highly of among friends.
2. Provides context to content referenced in education.
3. For new experiences and memories.
4. To understand the culture/way of life of the locals in the area.
5. To experience local cuisine.
6. The trip provides a time and place to focus on friends and family.
7. For religious purposes.

#### Digital Tools
1. Media (YouTube, Movies, Social Media): Provides romanticized and heavily curated views of culture and way of life.
2. Blogs: Provides real-life insight into the true tourist experience and/or  day-to-day life of a local.
3. Web search (Google, Tourism sites): Broad research of point of interests, safety information, etc.
4. Agenda apps (WanderLog): Map-based agenda and itinerary planning.
5. Transportation apps (Nader, Google Maps, AustralianETA): Provides country-specific directions for modes of transportation, ETA, and routes.
6. Airline apps (EasyJet, Delta, AirCanada): Certain countries have additional steps for international flight check-in processes. Provides updated flight information and necessary additional steps.
7. Translation apps (Duolingo, Google Translate, PapaGo, School): Alleviates the language barrier

#### Pre-Trip Apprehension
1. Safety: Fear of getting hurt or lost due to:
2. Language barrier
3. Transportation illiteracy
4. FOMO: Fear of missed experiences and opportunities to meet new people

#### Unexpected Cultural Customs
1. Demographics: Types of people -- especially in areas that speak English.
2. Progressive v. Conservative culture: Socially acceptable ways of dressing, speaking, looking (skin color).  
3. Restaurants/Service Industry: Tipping culture, expectations for customer service, unintentionally “disrespectful” actions (bringing water bottle, not tipping enough, utensil positioning).
4. Payment/Bargaining: Delineate between situations where it is acceptable/encouraged to haggle prices.
5. Transportation: Different modes of transportation, payment methods for each, infrastructure.

#### Communication Preparation
1. There was a unanimous lack of self-motivated communication preparation due to:
2. No time (last minute trip, busy schedule)
3. Didn’t feel the need to fit in (accepted that they were going to be treated as outsiders regardless of the amount of language preparation)
4. Intentional decision (to keep an open mind and preserve the exciting cultural “shock-factor”)
5. Everyone would probably speak English (only traveling to well-known tourist locations)
6. Didn’t feel the need to (until it was too late)
7. Depended on external party (friends who knew the area, tour groups)

#### Interactions
|People|Content|
|---|---|
|Service providers: Restaurant, shop, hotel, transportation workers and Students: The younger demographic.| Purchasing/Bartering, Directions, Recommendations, Meeting new people and understanding experiences, Greetings, By necessity | 

#### Struggles and (Attempted) Resolutions
|Struggles|(Attempted) Resolutions|
|---|---|
|Not knowing a language causes: Feelings of isolation, Inability to meet new people and learn about their culture, Barriers to obtaining desired items and foods, Difficulty in practicing and using language (need a starting point/foundation and beginner language courses typically do not provide practical, context-based information).| Attempts to alleviate the communication barrier includes: Miming and body language, and Using translation apps to communicate single words/phrases |

#### Overall Findings
Ultimately, it is important to reflect on the intriguing (yet overwhelming) amount of information learned from each of the employed research methods. 4 broad themes emerged for what the overall feel of the app should be. They are as follows:
1. Decrease awkwardness and clunky-ness of interactions: Shorten latency between question and response, remove socially abnormal behaviors like speaking into the phone to translate conversation.
2. Be immediate and on demand: Delivers content immediately
3. Provide relevant context (Currency exchange, culture-specific customs)
4. Provide tourism recommendations for authentic cultural attractions (restaurants, places, unique services)
The first 3 of themes were used to enhance the app experience. 

## Personas
Based on the interview research I chose 2 personas. One is Karla, who is a recent college graduate wanting to experience life abroad for the first time with a close friend. She’s been wanting to do this trip for a while and has planned everything out to the hour. On the other hand is Ian, who is a well traveled family man. He wants to make the experience as authentic and exciting for his family, and believes spontaneity to be the most important factor in having fun.

## User Flows
As reiterated in the beginning of each of the 3 usability tests, a low-fidelity prototype provides the ability for designers to test the flow of screens and the functionality for the app before intricate design changes are implemented. A total of 5 tasks were created based on the most important user needs from user testing. Those are
1. Task 1 - Onboard: Enter into the app and confirm location
2. Task 2 - Cultural integration: You’re with a group of 7 friends. Find a method of transportation and an estimate of how much transportation to the restaurant will cost.
3. Task 3 - Interpersonal communication: You tell your waiter that you like seafood so he recommends a shrimp dish called Aguachile. However, you have a peanut allergy. Ask the waiter whether the dish contains peanuts.
4. Task 4 - Safety: The waiter says yes. Edit the allergen tags for future reference.
5. Task 5 - Intercultural etiquette: Understand typical tipping rates for dining. Bookmark the topic for future reference.
 
The tasks are visualized in the diagram below

## User Testing
Iterations were represented by “versions,” and can be seen by the V1 (Version 1) and V2 (Version 2) labels. 
 
### Version 0
The first low-fidelity prototype, which will be called V0 was mocked up with pen and paper and only showed the login page, location confirmation notification, the home page, and category-specific page.
 
### Version 1
I eventually decided it would be easier to design directly in Figma using a Low-Fidelity wireframing kit, which is where V1 was mocked up. This version contained a Login page, Home page, About page, Edit function, and Vocabulary page. These pages were decided based on the user flow included at the beginning of this section. A few of the initial designs were overwritten by V2 as the changes were subtle and not worth keeping. After presenting flat, initial designs to users, I received useful feedback which I incorporated into V2 and also included in the table below 
|Feedback|Implemented design solution|
|---|---|
|Make layout simpler. What information is the most important? For example, when I see the cash related tags I expect to see the price in the same area.|Use other apps as reference for information presentation in a mobile format.|
|Too many dropdowns|Move etiquette section to a different tab. Minimize drop downs and make layouts consistent across pages.| 
|It is unnecessary for 3 editing dots to be present in each section if they all do the same thing.|Move the additional information (...) icon to the top of the section.|
|The section to edit is much too far from the keyboard.|Have the page automatically scroll so the section that is being edited lies directly above the keyboard.|

### Version 2 (Final)
In addition to editing the pre-existing Login page, Home page, About page, Edit function, and Vocabulary page, I added a Search page, Etiquette page, and included interactive bookmarks to sections that can be saved. This is the version in which I created a working prototype and tested it with 3 users. Although a surprising amount of the feedback was positive, as each task was fulfilled with minimal issues, there were quite a few recommendations on portions that hadn’t yet been built out. 
|Feedback|Proposed design solution|
|---|---|
|I prioritize convenience over price. I want to know what the quickest route to my final destination is using each of these types of transportation.|Model transportation section like Google Maps, where by default, the most convenient/quickest transportation option is displayed. Users can swipe/scroll for further information if a different type of transportation is preferred.|
|If asked to find a common phrase, I immediately navigate to conversations from the home tab or the search bar. I do not go to the dining tab even if the context is dining, because I may not have seen that section before.|Make the conversations tab a dictionary with common phrases.|
|Seems like the vocabulary tab is the same interface as the conversations category from the home page.|Delineate a better scope for each of these sections. Maybe one link to the other, or a section could be removed.|
|It is not immediately evident how to edit a page.|Update the (...) icon to an actual edit (pen) icon.|
