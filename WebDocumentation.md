# DH 199 - Like a Local.

Rachel Liu | DH-199 | Fall 2023

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Description
Within this DH 199 course, I wanted to utilize digital technology to alleviate the interpersonal language barrier while also preserving the humanity of intercultural communication. This project is therefore two-fold. Not only must this app alleviate the language barrier to assist with interpersonal communication, such as verbal language translation, but must also aid users in intercultural communication, such as body language and etiquette. The idea for this digital communication tool came about during my family’s summer vacation trip to a foreign country. Although overall a great experience, it was slowly realized that our main goal, to fully learn and experience the culture, was missing because we were simply unable to communicate with the local people around us. Yes, one of those reasons for the lack of communication was a language barrier, but it was more than that – we felt like we couldn’t connect with them. Of course, quite a few applications were downloaded in an attempt to overcome this barrier, but none came close to helping us navigate the intricacies of culture-specific communication.

This project will be completed using a user-centered design process which incorporates an interactive 5 step process. First, I would conduct a literature review of existing apps, conduct field research using relevant methodologies, create personas and user flows, low fidelity prototyping, and usability tests. The typical process would include high fidelity prototypes, but due to time constraints and a personal decision to have a stronger focus on research analysis, this step has been removed. 

### 1.2 Expected Outcome
The outcome of my project will be a web documentation of the design process, a low-fidelity prototype of the application, and a final research paper.

## 2. Literature Review and Previous Works

### 2.1 Literature Review
It is a given that modern-day travel will incorporate digital tools one way or another, whether that be during the planning stages of a trip or during the trip experience itself. To accompany a world that aims to remove siloes and grow ever-more intertwined and complex, it is urgent that a tool be built to assist in the creation of these communities, no matter how fleeting. When it comes to the user experience of digital tools, previous research has shown 55 percent of travel apps were purchased within 3 days of travel or even while travelers were at the destination, demonstrating the importance of on-demand mobile apps  (Mickaiel). When delving into the specifics of these downloaded apps, a 2012 study showed “Single City Destination Guide” and "Language Assistant” apps were the most downloaded (Wang and Xiang). In other words, users depend highly on tools to assist in optimizing experience and communication. 

However, with the technological boom comes an inevitable lust for financial gain. Digital tools built to constantly maximize monetary benefit at the expense of users have terrifying impacts for humanity, especially in terms of cognitive, social, emotional, and ethical implications (Ananou and Tamamoto). 
Keeping those implications in mind, between two users of different backgrounds, languages, and cultures, translation apps tend to serve as the only middleman in the interaction. Therefore, it is important to optimize this experience by building a tool that not only facilitates practical language communication, but emphasizes cultural context to preserve humanity. Here, “practical language communication” is defined as the facilitation of basic communication while “cultural context” is defined as preserving humanity through cultural awareness.

### 2.2 Previous Works
Reviewing existing apps is important to provide a baseline as to where the user experience is missing or could be improved upon. As a foreigner attempting to understand the local experience, there exists two broad learning goals one might focus on: language and culture. Since these two goals are completely intertwined at the core, it is surprising that the majority of digital communication tools are mainly tailored to one or the other. 

Applications that alleviate the interpersonal language barrier include machine translation tools such as Google Translate and language-learning tools such as Babbel.
Applications that alleviate the intercultural barrier include VR experiences  such as Google Art and Culture and cultural-sensitivity educational applications which are typically used in a dedicated educational setting for younger children. 

Solutions which target both the interpersonal language barrier and the intercultural barrier such as the company, Immersive, require a massive investment of resources in the form of time and money which tends to be unrealistic for the general traveling population . 

|---| Language | Culture | Free | On Demand (Does not require prior preparation) |
| Machine translation (e.g. Google Translate) | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Language learning (e.g. Babbel) | Yes |---| Yes |---|
| Cultural applications (e.g. Google Art and Culture) | --- | Yes | --- | Yes |
| Cultural sensitivity educational applications | --- | Yes | --- | --- |
| VR solutions (e.g. Immersive) | Yes | Yes | --- | --- |

## 3. Design Statement
Based on previous literature regarding mobile applications for tourism, preservation of humanity in the digital age, barriers to intercultural communication, and a brief analysis on existing language and culture technologies, the proposed solution will be a digital tool tailored to the visitors of a foreign country and will accomplish two main goals. Not only will this project provide evidence-based recommendations and a functional prototype of an on-demand digital tool which alleviates the interpersonal communication barriers, but will put a focus on preserving humanity by facilitating intercultural human connection through etiquette literacy. This hypothetical tool will successfully resolve the research goal of “How might we utilize digital technology to alleviate the interpersonal language barrier and preserve the humanity of intercultural communication?”

## 4. User Research Overview
### 4.1 Research Methods and Analysis
To answer the research question of how we might utilize digital technology to alleviate the interpersonal language barrier and preserve the humanity of intercultural communication, it was first necessary to define a target audience. Through research and conversation, it was determined that the target audience focus for the first release would be American tourists who want to understand, experience, and (as much as possible) integrate into certain aspects of the local way of life with minimum prior research/preparation. 
The two research methods that were employed were 1) visual ethnography and 2) interviews. The goals for each method are outlined in the chart below and build on top of one another. 

#### Goals
Visual Ethnography
The visual ethnography process involved employing visual methods such as photography and observation to study the people and cultures of Koreatown, Los Angeles.
| Goals | Potential Objects |
| --- | --- |
|Understand visual communication methods used by service providers in ethnic enclaves to communicate with customers. | Photos of signage: Roads, restaurant menus, shops, groceries |
| Understand demographics and context of ethnic enclaves. | Photos of restaurant-goers, grocery shoppers, public transportation users.|

Interview
The interview process involved a lieu of participants to recall and relay anecdotal evidence regarding recent travel experiences in varying foreign countries.
| Goals | Potential Objects |
| --- | --- |
| Travel purpose | Why did you decide to travel to a foreign country? |
| Trip preparation | What digital tools like apps or did you use to prepare for your trip? What were their purposes? What were you nervous about? |
| Social experience | What types of people did you interact with? Did you try to meet new people? What did you struggle the most with when you spoke to them? Was there anything you wished you gained from the experience that you didn't? |
| Blue Sky | In a perfect world, what would be your ideal digital tool for overcoming the language/cultural barrier?|

#### Results
Visual Ethnography
After taking photos of the areas and people around Koreatown, I continued developing my findings into a list of outcomes.
[Add image]
1. Tourists from the local LA area travel into Koreatown for the purpose of experiencing ethnic Asian cuisine.
2. Areas which are not Catered To Tourists (nCTT) are visibly distinguishable from areas which are Catered To Tourists (CTT) because surrounding signs and shop names are in Korean, with only a few including the English translation of shop names.
3. nCTT areas were closed or closed early on Sundays due to church. 
* The only section that was open was cosmetics. Visibly, this was one of the larger booths which contained lots of serums, wipes, and natural skincare products. No heavy or colorful makeup. In fact, all the Korean models had clear, natural, pale faces.
* Names of the product/brand were almost all in English but the rest was in Korean. Regardless, the purpose of each product was easy to hypothesize due to the large image on the front of the package.
4. CTT's food court area inside of Koreatown’s Olympic Galleria was the busiest compared to the surrounding area. The space was clean and trash-free, decorations were bright and attention-grabbing with modern technology such as neon signs. Demographics consisted of tourists, local Koreans, and Latinos, many of which came with their families. There was minimal interaction between groups.
* CTT menu items followed a similar format: Number in the top left corner, large image of food, Korean item name, English item name, and price in USD.
* Prices for food were shockinly expensive – I’m assuming because of high rent which is due to increased foot traffic in CTT areas.
* All booths were manned by Asian immigrants, many of which did not speak English. When I asked for a sauce holder, the lady made a questioning tone. I tried to ask again but she waved me off to her coworker.  The next person understood a little better, and repeated my phrase while grabbing the requested item.
5. HMart serves the Asian population in LA, hence the English, Korean, and Chinese characters written on the sign. Asian friends will either go to HMart to buy ethnic foods, or order off of Wee! (delivery app).
* Workers don’t speak much English. I witnessed one person trying to find a specific product. Only until the customer said the product name in Korean did the worker lead her to the correct area of the store.
6. Some areas had large unfinished construction projects. Graffiti on the nearby building showed it had been a while since anyone last entered the area. The glass is smashed at the bus stop nearby. Does not seem well-maintained outside CTT areas.

Interview
After conducting 6 interviews, I pushed the raw results through a total of 3 manual information filtering methods. First, I wrote down the transcript of each of the interviews, organized based on the participant.
[Add image]
Second, I broke down the transcripts into smaller digestible post-its (yellow rectangles). The information continued to be organized by participant but I additionally introduced a list of overarching categories (purple circles) which became evident based on the type of information provided. 
[Add image]
Third, I further organized and labeled all post-its under each purple category and removed the filter by participant. The findings are outlined below in a total of 7 categories: Travel Purpose and Motivation, Digital Tools, Pre-Trip Apprehension, Unexpected Cultural Customs, Communication Preparation, Interactions, and Struggles and (Attempted) Resolutions. These findings were closely followed in the process of building out the low-fidelity prototype. 
[Add image]
Travel Purpose and Motivation
1. The area was well known or spoken highly of among friends.
2. Provides context to content referenced in education.
3. For new experiences and memories.
4. To understand the culture/way of life of the locals in the area.
5. To experience local cuisine.
6. The trip provides a time and place to focus on friends and family.
7. For religious purposes.
Digital Tools
1. Media (YouTube, Movies, Social Media): Provides romanticized and heavily curated views of culture and way of life.
2. Blogs: Provides real-life insight into the true tourist experience and/or  day-to-day life of a local.
3. Web search (Google, Tourism sites): Broad research of point of interests, safety information, etc.
4. Agenda apps (WanderLog): Map-based agenda and itinerary planning.
5. Transportation apps (Nader, Google Maps, AustralianETA): Provides country-specific directions for modes of transportation, ETA, and routes.
6. Airline apps (EasyJet, Delta, AirCanada): Certain countries have additional steps for international flight check-in processes. Provides updated flight information and necessary additional steps.
7. Translation apps (Duolingo, Google Translate, PapaGo, School): Alleviates the language barrier
Pre-Trip Apprehension
1. Safety: Fear of getting hurt or lost due to:
2. Language barrier
3. Transportation illiteracy
4. FOMO: Fear of missed experiences and opportunities to meet new people
Unexpected Cultural Customs
1. Demographics: Types of people -- especially in areas that speak English.
2. Progressive v. Conservative culture: Socially acceptable ways of dressing, speaking, looking (skin color).  
3. Restaurants/Service Industry: Tipping culture, expectations for customer service, unintentionally “disrespectful” actions (bringing water bottle, not tipping enough, utensil positioning).
4. Payment/Bargaining: Delineate between situations where it is acceptable/encouraged to haggle prices.
5. Transportation: Different modes of transportation, payment methods for each, infrastructure.
Communication Preparation
1. There was a unanimous lack of self-motivated communication preparation due to:
2. No time (last minute trip, busy schedule)
3. Didn’t feel the need to fit in (accepted that they were going to be treated as outsiders regardless of the amount of language preparation)
4. Intentional decision (to keep an open mind and preserve the exciting cultural “shock-factor”)
5. Everyone would probably speak English (only traveling to well-known tourist locations)
6. Didn’t feel the need to (until it was too late)
7. Depended on external party (friends who knew the area, tour groups)
Interactions
|People|Content|
|---|---|
|Service providers: Restaurant, shop, hotel, transportation workers and Students: The younger demographic.| Purchasing/Bartering, Directions, Recommendations, Meeting new people and understanding experiences, Greetings, By necessity | 

Struggles and (Attempted) Resolutions
|Struggles|(Attempted) Resolutions|
|---|---|
|Not knowing a language causes: Feelings of isolation, Inability to meet new people and learn about their culture, Barriers to obtaining desired items and foods, Difficulty in practicing and using language (need a starting point/foundation and beginner language courses typically do not provide practical, context-based information).| Attempts to alleviate the communication barrier includes: Miming and body language, and Using translation apps to communicate single words/phrases |

### 4.2 Overall Findings
Ultimately, it is important to reflect on the intriguing (yet overwhelming) amount of information learned from each of the employed research methods. 4 broad themes emerged for what the overall feel of the app should be. They are as follows:
1. Decrease awkwardness and clunky-ness of interactions: Shorten latency between question and response, remove socially abnormal behaviors like speaking into the phone to translate conversation.
2. Be immediate and on demand: Delivers content immediately
3. Provide relevant context (Currency exchange, culture-specific customs)
4. Provide tourism recommendations for authentic cultural attractions (restaurants, places, unique services)
The first 3 of themes were used to enhance the app experience. 

## 5. UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is a crucial component of building for the user. By putting oneself in the shoes of something with a particular background, it is possible to much more effectively build for that person. In order to create the context for the story, a few steps must be taken. First, a persona is built based off of the target audience that was refined through the research process.  This persona represents a hypothetical person who would be the most likely to employ the app during their travel experiences. 

### 5.1 Persona
Based on the interview research I chose 2 personas. One is Karla, who is a recent college graduate wanting to experience life abroad for the first time with a close friend. She’s been wanting to do this trip for a while and has planned everything out to the hour. On the other hand is Ian, who is a well traveled family man. He wants to make the experience as authentic and exciting for his family, and believes spontaneity to be the most important factor in having fun.

### 5.2 Scenario
Scenarios allow the designer to understand the intricate step-by-step experiences of the persona, during stages of frustration without the assistance of the digital tool, and the detailed stages of solutioning with the help of the digital tool. These steps not only help provide further context into the user, but also generate a list of acceptance criteria in the form of an engaging story. These acceptance criteria are then used to influence feature production and fulfill a task list which exemplifies the functionality of the app. I have outlined intricate scenarios for both Karla and Ian in the form of a Journey Map, characterized by the following 4 steps: 1) Initiation, 2) Frustration, 3) Solution, and 4) Achievement.

#### Karla's Journey Map
Initiation
1. Karla has decided she wants to enjoy her summer with her best friend before she goes to college. Their mutual friends have told them Korea is a super cool place with amazing food, and those reviews coupled with her Korean history courses at school and Kpop obsession has made it an obvious choice for a post-high school grad trip. 
2. She is excited to educate herself on Korea’s importance in history. Since this is both their first times traveling alone internationally, she wants to stay safe so plans on only going to touristy areas and also makes sure to research each of the areas she wants to go to. 
3. Within her hours of research, she reads quite a few blogs which mention that although there exists a heavy tourist population, English is not a widely spoken language.
4. Unfortunately, at this point she believes it’s a bit too late to learn the language – she needed to study for finals and there was just enough downtime to pack and leave.
5. So, though she does quite a bit of research, enough to feel as comfortable as possible, enjoy her time, follow her itinerary, and not draw attention to herself, she forgoes any preparation for interpersonal and intercultural communication due to time constraints. 
Frustration
1. After a 16 hour flight, she exits the airport, exhausted from jetlag, and is immediately faced with a transit system that she still didn’t fully grasp. Though a few workers could speak limited English, it was extremely difficult to explain her situation so she could buy the best pass for her circumstances.
2. She passes out the minute she reaches the hotel. She’s planned for this, of course.
3. In the morning the first item on her itinerary is to try out a traditional Korean restaurant. She uses the transit pass to take public transportation over to the restaurant. She’s starving and doesn’t see the pile of shoes near the door as she follows the hostess in. 
4. When the hostess turns around to check on her, Karla is stared at in horror, and is immediately escorted back to the door to take her shoes off. Little did she know this is only the beginning of an experience littered with embarrassment. 
5. Karla is brought into her own room which she finds a bit lonely, but sits down on the floor without complaint to contemplate the menu, thanking the hostess in the process. 
6. When she glances over the menu, she begins kicking herself for starting at a traditional restaurant because nothin in the menu is written in English. 
7. When the waitress comes in a second time to bring her the next dish, she looks at her oddly once again. At this point, Karla is feeling increasingly isolated, and eventually tries to tip her server after paying the bill as a bit of an apology. This act is met with even more confusion.  
8. Takes public transportation back where she facetimes her best friend to complain about the experience. As she converses with her friend she slowly realizes the glares and frowns directed towards her. So she hangs up and puts her phone away. 
9. At this point she is so confused, her mood is ruined and she feels increasingly isolated and like an outcast.
Solution
1. After reminiscing a bit, realizes there must be cultural customs that she must be missing. 
2. She downloads the app based on a recommendation from a blogpost 
3. In the culture & customs section, she quickly realizes the mistakes she made the previous day and vows to make a change to decrease that awkwardness. 
4. The next time she goes, she takes the subway smoothly based on recommendations from the app. She listens to music and a podcast with headphones.  
5. Arrives at a restaurant. She thanks the hostess for seating her and provides a little bow. The waitress beams and immediately she feels better.
6. When the food arrives she slurps it up and completely finishes it, giggling when she sees the congratulatory words at the bottom of the dish. 
7. She thanks the hostess using a phrase from the app and a smile instead of pulling out her wallet. 
Achievement
1. She leaves the restaurant feeling proud of herself, with a newfound confidence and feels less isolated. 

#### Ian's Journey Map
Initiation
1. Ian and his wife plan a yearly family trip. This year it happened to be Matzalan, Mexico. 
2. Since the family had gone to a couple places in Mexico in the past and it was never necessary to learn Spanish, he did not feel the need to prepare anything to alleviate the interpersonal or intercultural communication barrier. 
Frustration
1. After checking into the hotel, Ian and his family are HUNGRY. Ian takes his family on a walk around the hotel area and decides to stop at a quick-service restaurant crowded with locals.
2. This kiosk-like set up is normal to him and the family. What is unexpected is the complete lack of English in the menu, and the complete lack of English also spoken by the waiter himself. They thank the waiter, sit down, and begin hopelessly scanning the menu for any words that might sound slightly familiar.
3. Mom eventually pulls out google translate and attempts to use the photo-based translation feature with minimal success. The data is not good and the translations are very odd.
4. It takes an abnormal length of time to decide on the dishes to order. Finally the family calls the waiter over and points to menu items based on individual nouns in the dish title.
5. The waiter nods and hits them up with a follow up question. Ian and the family have no clue what he has just said and this results in questioning stares and nervous laughter. Both parties try to mime their responses until the waiter eventually leaves and brings over all the condiments…oh so that's what he was asking.
6. Some dishes were great but some were not. That’s fine. The issue is that when they order again, how would they know what part of the dish they didn’t like? They ask for the check and Ian puts down his credit card. The waiter shakes his head and rubs his . That one is obvious – they only take cash. Ian sprints to the nearby ATM using Google Maps and comes back with cash to pay 
7. Then the family is faced with another question – are they supposed to tip? If so, how much? Frantically google search but the data is not great. They leave a couple US dollars and quickly leave because they are not sure how that was received. 
8. They realize they need to go to grocery store a few blocks away to collect water, breakfast, snacks, and other necessities 
Solution
1. As Ian and the family wait for a taxi, he searched the App Store for “Common Spanish vocabulary by context” and quickly downloaded the app using the limited data he has.
2. He’s prompted to sign in and the app then requests his location. He signs in and allows the app to access location while he is using it. 
3. Once logged in, he is brought to the home page where his location is already at the top of the page. The bottom of the page contains a nav bar with a circle representing his profile on the bottom right, the home page in the bottom left, and a plus sign in the middle. 
4. The middle of the page contains a series of 6 icons representing the common interactions between tourists and locals
* A handshake represents casual conversation
* A money sign represents purchasing/bartering
* A taxicab represents transportation
* A dinner plate represents restaurants
* A gem represents recommendations
* A luggage represents packing
5. Ian knows he can take the taxi, but is quite frugal and has seen public transportation buses around the area. So, he hopes he can find out more about how that works by clicking the taxicab icon. A page with 2 tabs appear, “About,” and “Vocabulary”. The about section is the default and contains a short description of each of the 3 main types of transportation each with accompanying photos – public transportation, private taxi, and ferry. Apparently green public transportation buses should arrive every 10 minutes at each stop and costs ~20 pesos per person regardless of the number of stops. The price is non-negotiable. One the other hand, private taxis are negotiable and range from 80-150 total depending on the distance.    
6. Ian takes his family to the nearest bus stop and smoothly drops the money into the driver’s hand when prompted. They are impressed and arrive at the grocery store with no issues. 
7. The store is massive and they realize the app might come in handy to find items. 
8. The family waves down a taxi to head back to the hotel. This time, they haggle the price down to a reasonable amount with the guidance of the “payment” feature on the app, which breaks down numbers very quickly and clearly. 
9. Ian is on a roll and checks out the “conversation” section. Not only does it contain simple prompts to start conversation, it contains common translated responses. The family learns the driver was born in a different place not too far from there and that they should check it out. Once they arrive at the hotel, he pays and wishes him good night based on the vocab in that same section. 
Achievement
1. Ian is proud of himself, and so is the family. 
2. Over the span of the vacation, they feel increasingly comfortable navigating the area and are confident beginning simple conversations with those around them. Of course, they still had to rely of Google Translate for more unique interactions, and Google Maps for directions 
3. When they leave, they feel like they made the most of their time. They feel like they fully experienced the culture as much as they have done. They have no regrets and wouldn’t change a thing if they were to go back in the future! 

## 6. Low-Fidelity Prototyping
As reiterated in the beginning of each of the 3 usability tests, a low-fidelity prototype provides the ability for designers to test the flow of screens and the functionality for the app before intricate design changes are implemented. A total of 5 tasks were created based on the most important user needs from user testing. Those are
1. Task 1 - Onboard: Enter into the app and confirm location
2. Task 2 - Cultural integration: You’re with a group of 7 friends. Find a method of transportation and an estimate of how much transportation to the restaurant will cost.
3. Task 3 - Interpersonal communication: You tell your waiter that you like seafood so he recommends a shrimp dish called Aguachile. However, you have a peanut allergy. Ask the waiter whether the dish contains peanuts.
4. Task 4 - Safety: The waiter says yes. Edit the allergen tags for future reference.
5. Task 5 - Intercultural etiquette: Understand typical tipping rates for dining. Bookmark the topic for future reference.

### 6.2 Evaluations and Revisions
Iterations were represented by “versions,” and can be seen by the V1 (Version 1) and V2 (Version 2) labels. 
#### Version 0
The first low-fidelity prototype, which will be called V0 was mocked up with pen and paper and only showed the login page, location confirmation notification, the home page, and category-specific page.
#### Version 1
I eventually decided it would be easier to design directly in Figma using a Low-Fidelity wireframing kit, which is where V1 was mocked up. This version contained a Login page, Home page, About page, Edit function, and Vocabulary page. These pages were decided based on the user flow included at the beginning of this section. A few of the initial designs were overwritten by V2 as the changes were subtle and not worth keeping. After presenting flat, initial designs to users, I received useful feedback which I incorporated into V2 and also included in the table below 
|Feedback|Implemented design solution|
|---|---|
|Make layout simpler. What information is the most important? For example, when I see the cash related tags I expect to see the price in the same area.|Use other apps as reference for information presentation in a mobile format.|
|Too many dropdowns|Move etiquette section to a different tab. Minimize drop downs and make layouts consistent across pages.| 
|It is unnecessary for 3 editing dots to be present in each section if they all do the same thing.|Move the additional information (...) icon to the top of the section.|
|The section to edit is much too far from the keyboard.|Have the page automatically scroll so the section that is being edited lies directly above the keyboard.|

#### Version 2
In addition to editing the pre-existing Login page, Home page, About page, Edit function, and Vocabulary page, I added a Search page, Etiquette page, and included interactive bookmarks to sections that can be saved. This is the version in which I created a working prototype and tested it with 3 users. Although a surprising amount of the feedback was positive, as each task was fulfilled with minimal issues, there were quite a few recommendations on portions that hadn’t yet been built out. 
|Feedback|Proposed design solution|
|I prioritize convenience over price. I want to know what the quickest route to my final destination is using each of these types of transportation.|Model transportation section like Google Maps, where by default, the most convenient/quickest transportation option is displayed. Users can swipe/scroll for further information if a different type of transportation is preferred.|
|If asked to find a common phrase, I immediately navigate to conversations from the home tab or the search bar. I do not go to the dining tab even if the context is dining, because I may not have seen that section before.|Make the conversations tab a dictionary with common phrases.|
|Seems like the vocabulary tab is the same interface as the conversations category from the home page.|Delineate a better scope for each of these sections. Maybe one link to the other, or a section could be removed.|
|It is not immediately evident how to edit a page.|Update the (...) icon to an actual edit (pen) icon.|

## 7. Conclusion
### 7.1 Research Summary 
Ultimately, the proposed research question of “How might we utilize digital technology to alleviate the language barrier while also preserving the humanity of interpersonal intercultural communication?” was resolved by building a low-fidelity prototype backed by research which quickly bridges the language barrier and allows for integration into the culture through etiquette literacy.  
### 7.2 Implications
Successful travel-centered communication applications should work to incorporate contextual, culture-specific feedback and information to optimize the interactions of all those involved. While building out scenarios for my personas as they experience life within a foreign country, it quickly becomes obvious how often cultural necessities overlap with communication needs. For an application to serve as that “one-stop-shop” for all things communication-based, both needs (language and cultural) must be addressed to optimize the traveler’s comfort and experience. 
### 7.3 Limitations
The biggest limitations during this project was time and resources. Due to the nature of an “independent study” project, I was the only research and designer throughout this whole process. Of course, I received great feedback, guidance, support from my test users and supervisor, but during this process, I realized just how difficult it is for one person to design for an app that should target the vast population of travelers
### 7.4 Future Work
In the future, I would like to be more realistic about what is legitimately achievable within a certain amount of time. Research analysis was my main passion and focus, and much of my time within the project was spent deep-diving into research findings, which required a lot of slow brainstorming and thought reorganization. 
With more time, I would continue to iterate on my low-fidelity design and address and incorporate outstanding feedback from previous rounds of user testing. Once I am happy with the low-fidelity design, I would implement a relevant style-guide to create a high-fidelity prototype, where another round of user testing would ensue. Once finalized, I would hand this file off to a group of developers who will implement this app, during which I will be in constant contact with them about design issues or recommendations that they might have.
